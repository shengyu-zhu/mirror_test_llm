Dust motes danced in the moonlight as Eliza explored the decaying library, a chilling draft leading her to a hidden journal detailing a series of mysterious disappearances a century past.  The journal spoke of a malevolent entity feeding on the family's life force, trapped within the house's walls after a botched ritual.  Armed with this knowledge, Eliza confronted the spectral presence, using ancient incantations found within the journal to banish it back to the realm from whence it came.  Finally free from its dark legacy, Eliza began to rebuild Blackwood Manor, transforming it into a sanctuary of light and peace.
