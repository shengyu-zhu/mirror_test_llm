One rainy evening, Jamie stumbled upon an ancient amulet in the attic and felt a strange warmth surge through their body—moments later, they stood on four paws, staring at their reflection as a sleek black cat. Overjoyed, Jamie spent days transforming into different creatures, soaring as an eagle and swimming as a dolphin, but the thrill faded when they realized they couldn’t always control the shifts. Panic set in when they turned into a wolf during a family dinner, sending their parents screaming from the table. Desperate, Jamie sought out a reclusive sage, who warned that the amulet’s magic demanded balance: every shift stole a piece of their humanity.
